Analysis of Wind Speed and Humidity Relationship (Excel) Objective: Examine the relationship between wind speed and humidity in Delhi using weather data.
Visualizations & Methods: Histogram: Displayed distributions of wind speed and humidity to assess normality. Scatter Plot: Illustrated the relationship between variables with a linear trendline. Box Plot: Identified outliers and compared data distributions. Network Graph: Visualized complex variable relationships (if applicable). Density Plot: Detailed distribution analysis.

Key Findings: Weak negative correlation (−0.34) between wind speed and humidity. Near-normal distributions with slight skewness.

Impact of Education on Labor Market Outcomes (Python) Objective: Evaluate how years of schooling affect labor force participation, wage employment, and hourly wages in Turkey.
Visualizations & Methods: Bar Chart: Compared averages (e.g., labor participation by gender). Line Chart: Tracked trends over time. OLS & IV Regression: Addressed endogeneity bias. Scatter Plot with Trendline: Showed linear relationships (e.g., education vs. wages).

Key Findings: Education positively impacts labor participation (especially for women). IV estimates often exceeded OLS, suggesting underestimated effects in OLS.

Financial Data Analysis with GARCH Model (Python) Objective: Model volatility in asset returns using GARCH.
Visualizations & Methods: Histogram & Q-Q Plot: Assessed normality of returns. Scatter Plot: Explored pairwise asset relationships. Time Series Plot: Displayed return fluctuations over time. Conditional Volatility Plot: Output from GARCH to predict volatility.

Key Findings: Returns were non-normal but roughly symmetric. GARCH confirmed past volatility’s impact on current volatility.

Asset Correlation & Risk Analysis (Excel) Objective: Analyze correlations and volatility among three financial assets for portfolio management.
Visualizations & Methods: Histogram: Return distributions for each asset. Scatter Plot: Pairwise correlations with regression lines. Line Chart: Return trends over time. Correlation/Covariance Matrix: Quantified statistical relationships.

Key Findings: Strong correlation (0.98) between some assets. Higher-variance assets (e.g., Asset3) carried greater risk.
